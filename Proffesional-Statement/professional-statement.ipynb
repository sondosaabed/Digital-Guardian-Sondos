    "Two of my strengths that I have a remarkable ability to learn new technologies and upskill, I also have strong written and verbal communication. As for my values, I strongly believe in protecting user’s privacy and data. My main mantra is “People before profit”.

I want to be able to protect others, and companies, and be aware of such issues. I believe that my values, strengths, and interest in cybersecurity have made me fit with the security goals of various organizations. "
